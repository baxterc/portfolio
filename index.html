            <h4>I'm currently enrolled at <a href="http://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>, which is a coding school located in Portland, Oregon.  I'm still learning the ropes, but I'm on my way!  Take a look at the work I've done so far, learn more about me, or feel free to get in touch with me.</h4>

          <span id="nocushion"><h3>I've been working on a few projects to master HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.</h3></span>

          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/baxterc/portfolio">Wikipedia</a>
              <p>Uses HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. This was an attempt to reproduce Wikipedia's <strong>styling and formatting</strong> (rather than its behavior).  The main goals here were to:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Become comfortable using divs alongside Bootstrap's grid system to create columnar content.</li>
                <li>Use spans for inline formatting.</li>
                <li>Float images correctly based on the actual site's formatting.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>

            <li><a href="https://github.com/baxterc/shelter">Animal Shelter</a>
              <p>Uses HTML and CSS.  This page primarily demonstrates some of the basic principles that make CSS powerful:<p>
              <ol>
                <li>Cascading - The order that CSS uses to determine how to combine rules.</li>
                <li>Inheritance - Rules applied to a parent element will apply to child elements nested within that parent element. </li>
                <li>Specificity - The most specific rule applied to an element takes precedence over other rules.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>

            <li><a href="https://github.com/baxterc/band">KISS Fan Site</a>
              <p>Uses HTML and CSS.  A basic page designed to show how the box model works.  Using CSS classes, block elements can be reshaped and realigned relative to one another.</p>
            </li>

            <li><a href="https://github.com/baxterc/boring_lecture">Boring Lecture</a>
              <p>Uses HTML and CSS.  This page uses CSS classes via spans and divs to create different text formats rather than using inline formatting via HTML.</p>
            </li>

            <li><a href="https://github.com/baxterc/hello-world">Hello World</a>
              <p>The first page I made at Epicodus!  It uses only HTML.  The page itself introduces the most basic HTML elements.  I also used it to get acquainted with how to use Git (making commits, pushing, cloning, and so on.)</p>

              <img src="img/me.jpg">
              <p>I was born and raised in Portland.  After graduating from Portland State Universiy with a B.A. in History, I started working for Multnomah County.  My most recent position was with the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office working as an office assistant and a records technician <em>(nobody laughs when I say that's just a fancy way of saying that I was a DJ)</em>.  After a few years of working nights and feeling unsure about the direction my life was taking, I decided to learn how to program.  I'm entering a new world with wide eyes and an eager mind.</p>

              <img src="img/elowah.jpg">
              <p>I love where I live.  When I'm not mulling algorithms and filling my brain with other digital notions, I like to spend my weekends outside.  A day spent in the Columbia River Gorge, the Oregon Coast, or any of the nearby national forests is a day well spent, especially if I've got my fishing rod with me.  I'm also an avid (if not somewhat distracted) gardener.</p>

              <img src="img/fergus.jpg">
              <p>Wherever I am, my heart's at home.  I have a temperamental little house in Northeast Portland where I live with the love of my life, Katie (who is responsible for all of the photos on this site-- give her <a href="http://www.flickr.com/katiehelmer">Flickr</a> a look!)  The gentleman in the photo above is Fergus, our hilarious and loving little dog.
